# Traits:

- traits define required behavior for types in Rust.
- composition over inheritance is a preferred approach.
- generic functions can work with any type that fit entirely on the stack.
- traits support inheritance, allowing for trait hierarchies.
- default behaviors can be provided in traits, and they can be overridden in implementations.
