# Rust Structs:

### Summary:

Structs in Rust are similar to classes in other languages by lack inheritance. They consist of data fields, methods, and associated functions. The syntax for defining a struct includes the `struct` keyword, the struct name in capital-camel case, and field definitions within curly braces. Instantiating a struct requires specifing values for each field. Associated functions, resembling constructors, are offen used for creating structs with default values.

### Key Takeaways:

1. Rust uses struct instead of classes, which include data fields, methods, and associated functions.
2. Struct definition syntax involves the `struct` keyword, the name, and field definitions within curly braces.
3. Instantiating a struct requires specifing values for each field.
4. Associated functions, similar to constructors, are commonly used for struct instantiation.
5. methods and associated functions are defined in a separate implementation block using the `impl` keyword.
6. The scope operator in Rust is double colons (`::`), used to access associated functions.
7. Rust lacks struct inheritance but utilizes Traits as a better solution, introducing the topic for the next video.
